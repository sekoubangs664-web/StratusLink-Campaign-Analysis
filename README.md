This project analyzes national digital advertising performance for StratusLink Communications to identify the most cost-efficient states, audiences, devices, creative formats, and publisher inventory to guide smarter budget allocation. Using CTR, CPA, CPM, viewability, impressions, and conversion rate trends, the analysis revealed strong engagement in Florida and Connecticut, high performance in the Northeast, and major opportunities in suburban markets, younger audiences, mobile devices, and premium publishers. Through creative testing, the 728×90px format paired with “Get Unlimited” proved the most efficient, achieving up to 84% CVR in top states, while publisher evaluation highlighted partners such as WebMD and Architectural Digest as the strongest sources of visibility. These insights informed strategic recommendations focused on reallocating spend to high-performing environments, optimizing inventory quality, and scaling top creative and messaging to improve efficiency and reduce wasted advertising spend.
